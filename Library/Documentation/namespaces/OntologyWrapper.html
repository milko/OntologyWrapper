        <div class="details collapse"><p>The main purpose of this trait is to add status management to classes, this is done by
adding a bitfield {@link $mStatus} data member and a set of methods that handle this
bitfield.</p>
<p>This trait defines the common methods for managing the bitfield data member and handles
the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>{@link kFLAG_STATE_INITED}</tt>: This flag indicates that the object is ready
    to be used and is set by the {@link isInited()} method; if the flag is not set,
    it means that the object is not functional.
<li><tt>{@link kFLAG_STATE_DIRTY}</tt>: This flag is set whenever the object's offsets
    are modified and it can be managed by the {@link isDirty()} method. For persistent
    objects it is an indication that the object should be updated; if the flag is not
    set, it means that the object persistent properties are in the same state as when it
    was loaded from a persistent store.
<li><tt>{@link kFLAG_STATE_COMMITTED}</tt>: This flag is set whenever the object is
    either loaded from or stored in a persistent store and can be managed by the
    {@link isCommitted()} method. It is an indication that the object is persistent; if
    the flag is not set, it means that the object was not loaded from or stored in a
    persistent store.
<li><tt>{@link kFLAG_STATE_ENCODED}</tt>: This flag indicates an encoded state and can
    be managed by the {@link isEncoded()} method, which means that some object offsets
    have been encoded and need to be decoded before the object is saved in a persistent
    store or effectively used. This state is often associated to the network
    transmission of objects: some data types must be converted prior to be sent over the
    network; if the flag is not set, it means that the object can be saved in a
    persistent store or serialised for being transmitted on the network.
</ul>
<p>All the flag accessor methods are protected, since they provide access to the internal
workings of the object, if you need to provide status information you should do so by
using these methods in a public interface.</p></div>

        <h1>TagObject<a href="../classes/OntologyWrapper.TagObject.html">¶</a></h1>
        <p class="short_description">Tag object</p>
        <div class="details collapse"><p>This class extends {@link OntologyObject} to implement a concrete tag object class.</p>
<p>A tag object is used to <i>identify</i>, <i>document</i> and <i>share</i> a data
property, it represents the <i>metadata</i> of a data property, or its <i>definition</i>
in an ontology.</p>
<p>This class features a {@link kTAG_TERMS} offset which is an array of {@link TermObject}
references representing a path of vertex and predicate terms of the ontology graph, this
chain of elements represents a lexical construct, like a phrase, that provides the
explanation or definition of the current object.</p>
<p>Using a chain of terms, rather than a single term, to provide metadata for a data element
gives much more flexibility and reusability when defining a data dictionary. This
sequence is divided in three main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Feature</i>: The first vertex represents the data element feature or trait, this
    term defines <em>what the data element is</em>.
<li><i>Method</i>: The vertices between the first and the last ones represent the
    <em>methodology</em> or <em>method</em> by which the described data was obtained.
<li><i>Scale</i>: The last vertex of the path represents the <em>unit</em> or
    <em>scale</em> in which the described value is expressed in.
</ul>
<p>The concatenation of these term references, separated by the
{@link kTOKEN_INDEX_SEPARATOR} becomes the object global identifier which is stored in
the object's native identifier offset.</p>
<p>Tags have another offset, {@link kTAG_SEQ}, which is an integer sequence number: this
value must be unique within the tags domain of the current ontology. Unlike global
identifiers, this value may change across implementations, but this is the value used to
uniquely identify tags among the other elements of the ontology and database.</p>
<em>All offsets in all classes, including this one, are tag sequence numbers, which makes
the Tag class key in the structure and behaviour of all the elements implemented in this
library</em>.

The class features the following default offsets:

<ul>
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_NID}</tt>: <em>Native identifier</em>. This required attribute holds
    a string value which represents the global identifier of the current object. This
    identifier is immutable and represents the unique key. This string is constituted by
    the concatenation of all term references stored in the current object's branch,
    {@link kTAG_TERMS}. This attribute must be managed with its offset; in derived
    classes it will be automatically assigned end only available as read-only.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_SEQ}</tt>: <em>Sequence</em>. This required attribute holds
    an integer value which represents the current object's sequence number, as with the
    global identifier, this value must be unique, except that it may change across
    implementations. All offset keys in all objects derived from this class ancestor are
    references to this sequence number. This attribute must be managed with its offset;
    in derived classes it will be automatically assigned end only available as
    read-only.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_TERMS}</tt>: <em>Branch</em>. This required attribute holds
    the list of terms comprising the current tag: this is an array of term references
    provided as an odd sequence of vertices and predicates forming a path of the
    ontology graph in which the first vertex defines the feature, the middle ones
    define the methodology and the last element indicates the scale or unit. To populate
    the elements of this path, use the {@link TermPush()} amd {@link TermPop()}
    offset accessor methods which respectively add and remove elements of the branch as
    if it was a stack.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_DATA_TYPE}</tt>: <em>Data type</em>. This attribute is an enumerated
    set of values listing all the <em>data types</em> that the value of the property
    defined by the current tag may take. To populate and handle individual data types
    use the {@link DataType()} offset accessor method. This property is
    <em>required</em> by all tag objects.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_DATA_KIND}</tt>: <em>Data kind</em>. This attribute is an enumerated
    set of values providing the <em>data attributes</em> of the property defined by the
    current tag. This may be whether the property is a list of values, or if the
    property is required or not. To populate and handle individual data kinds use the
    {@link DataKind()} offset accessor method.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_LABEL}</tt>: <em>Label</em>. The label represents the <i>name or
    short description</i> of the data property that the current object defines. All tags
    <em>should</em> have a label, since this is how human users will be able to identify
    and select them. This attribute has the {@link kTYPE_KIND_VALUE} data type, which
    is constituted by a list of elements in which the {@link kTAG_SUB_LANGUAGE} item holds
    the label language code and the {@link kTAG_SUB_TEXT} holds the label text. To
    populate and handle labels by language, use the {@link Label()} offset accessor
    method.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_DESCRIPTION}</tt>: <em>Description</em>. The description tag
    represents the <i>description or extended definition</i> of the property that the
    current tag defines. The description is similar to the <em>definition</em>, except
    that while the definition provides a description of the object it defines unrelated
    to context, the description adds to the definition the elements added by the current
    context. All tags <em>should</em> have a description, if the tag label is not enough
    to provide a sufficient description or definition. Descriptions have the
    {@link kTYPE_KIND_VALUE} data type, which is constituted by a list of elements in
    which the {@link kTAG_SUB_LANGUAGE} item holds the description language code and the
    {@link kTAG_SUB_TEXT} holds the description text. To populate and handle
    descriptions by language, use the {@link Description()} offset accessor method.
</ul>

The {@link __toString()} method will return the value stored in the global identifier,
if set, or the computed global identifier which is the concatenation of all term
references stored in the {@link kTAG_TERMS} offset, separated by the
{@link kTOKEN_INDEX_SEPARATOR}.

The class also features a pair of methods, {@link Feature()} and {@link Scale()}, which
respectively return the first and last vertex of the ontology branch this object
represents: the feature is a term that represents the main feature or trait that the
current tag defines, the scale is a term that represents the scale or unit in which
values defined by the current tag are expressed in.

Objects of this class can hold any additional attribute that is considered necessary or
useful to define and share the current tag. In this class we define only those
attributes that constitute the core functionality of the object, derived classes will add
attributes specific to the domain in which the object will operate and eventually
restrict the functionality of other offsets to provide referential integrity.</div>

        <div class="details collapse"><p>This class is the ancestor of classes that define objects that handle structured data and
that are persistent.</p>
<p>The class extends <code>{@link ArrayObject}</code> by treating the inherited array as the
persistent store and all other data members as run-time data. The convention is that
items stored in the array part of the object are called <em>offsets</em> and are
considered <em>persistent</em>, while all other data members are called <em>members</em>
and are considered <em>run-time</em> data.</p>
<p>This class implements a framework that governs tha management of the object's persistent
data. No offset may hold the <tt>NULL</tt> value, setting an offset with <tt>NULL</tt>
value is equivalent to <em>deleting the offset</em>.</p>
<p>Retrieving non-existant offsets will <em>not</em> generate a warning, but only return</p>
<tt>NULL</tt>.

The class features a series of methods that derived classes may use to customise the
behaviour of the offset management methods:

<ul>
<li><tt>{@link preOffsetExists()}</tt>: This method is called <i>before</i> the
    {@link offsetExists()} method with the offset passed as a reference parameter, the
    method can be used to change the value of the offset or to provide a custom result:
    if the method returns <tt>NULL</tt>, {@link offsetExists()} will be called; if the
    method returns any other type of value, this will be returned and
    {@link offsetExists()} will be skipped.
<li><tt>{@link preOffsetGet()}</tt>: This is called <i>before</i> the
    {@link offsetGet()} method with the offset passed as a reference parameter, the
    method can be used to change the value of the offset or to provide a custom result:
    if the method returns <tt>NULL</tt>, {@link offsetGet()} will be called; if the
    method returns any other type of value, this will be returned and
    {@link offsetGet()} will be skipped.
<li><tt>{@link preOffsetSet()}</tt>: This is called <i>before</i> the
    {@link offsetSet()} method with the offset and value passed as reference parameters,
    the method can be used to change the offset or the value: if the method returns
    <tt>NULL</tt>, {@link offsetSet()} will be called; if the method returns any other
    type of value, the {@link offsetSet()} will be skipped.
<li><tt>{@link postOffsetSet()}</tt>: This is called <i>after</i> the
    {@link offsetSet()} method with the offset and value passed as reference parameters,
    the method can be used to set status or statistical variables, it will only be
    called if the {@link offsetSet()} method was called.
<li><tt>{@link preOffsetUnset()}</tt>: This is called <i>before</i> the
    {@link offsetUnset()} method with the offset passed as a reference parameter, the
    method can be used to change the offset: if the method returns <tt>NULL</tt>,
    {@link offsetUnset()} will be called; if the method returns any other type of value,
    the {@link offsetUnset()} will be skipped.
<li><tt>{@link postOffsetUnset()}</tt>: This is called <i>after</i> the
    {@link offsetUnset()} method with the offset passed as a reference parameter, the
    method can be used to set status or statistical variables, it will only be called if
    the {@link offsetUnset()} method was called.
</ul>

The class features a series of methods that are useful for handling the persistent data
as a whole:

<ul>
<li><em>{@link arrayKeys()}</em>: This method is the equivalent of the
    {@link array_keys()} function.
<li><em>{@link arrayValues()}</em>: This method is the equivalent of the
    {@link array_values()} function.
</ul>

The class features a static method, {@link Object2Array}, that can be used to
convert a structure of nested {@link ArrayObject} instances into a nested array, this
will be useful when normalising objects before persisting.

This class implements a series of methods that can be used by member accessor methods to
handle properties and offsets in a standard way:

<ul>
<li><em>{@link manageOffset()}</em>: This method provides a standard interface to set,
    retrieve and delete offset values.
<li><em>{@link manageSetOffset()}</em>: This method provides a standard interface to
    set, retrieve and delete elements of an array set, this method provides access to
    elements of the offset, rather than to the offset, which must be an array or
    {@link ArrayObject}.
<li><em>{@link manageElementMatchOffset()}</em>: This method provides a standard
    interface to set, retrieve and delete elements of an array or {@link ArrayObject},
    these elements are an array of two items in which the first one is the discriminator
    and the second is the value.
<li><em>{@link manageProperty()}</em>: This method provides a standard interface to set,
    retrieve and reset data members.

        <div class="details collapse"><p>This <i>abstract</i> class is the ancestor of all classes representing connection
instances, such as servers, databases and collections.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this class is to wrap a common interface around concrete instances of
specific server, database or collection or engines.</p>
<p>The class features the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>{@link $mDSN}</tt>: The <i>data source name</i>, it is an URL that represents
    the connection string.
<li><tt>{@link $mConnection}</tt>: The <i>connection resource</i>, it represents the
    native connection.
<li><tt>{@link $mParent}</tt>: The <i>parent connection</i>, it represents the instance
    derived from this class that instantiated the current object.
</ul>
<p>The object is instantiated by providing a parameter that may either be a connection URL,
such as a string that may be parsed by the {@link parse_url()} function, or an array
containing the connection parameters.</p>
<p>The public interface of this class, as well as for many other abstract classes, is
implemented as templates in which protected methods do the actual work, so derived
concrete classes should only need to implement the protected interface.</p>
<p>This class declares three methods for managing the connection:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>{@link isConnected()}</tt>: Returns <tt>TRUE</tt> if the connection is open.
<li><tt>{@link openConnection()}</tt>: Create and open the connection.
<li><tt>{@link closeConnection()}</tt>: Close and reset the connection.
</ul>
<p>When the object goes out of context it will close the connection, if open, and re-open it
once it gets back into context:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>{@link __sleep()}</tt>: This method will close the connection, if open, and
    set the {@link $mConnection connection} property to <tt>TRUE</tt> as an indication
    that the connection must be opened once the object gets back into scope.
<li><tt>{@link __wakeup()}</tt>: This method will open the connection, if the object
    went out of scope while the connection was open.
</ul>
<p>The class provides accessor methods for the object properties: the {@link $mDSN} data
member can be managed with the {@link DSN()} method, the {@link $mConnection} data
member can be retrieved with the {@link Connection()} method and the {@link $mParent}
data member can be retrieved with the {@link Parent()} method.</p>
<p>When setting the connection string, {@link DSN()}, the object's connection parameters
will be synchronised. When setting offsets, the data source name will not be changed.
When the connection is opened, {@link openConnection()}, the data source name will be
re-constituted using the object's offsets. This means that the object offsets represent
the actual connection parameters, although setting the DSN will reset these parameters to
match the connection URL.</p>
<p>When the connection is {@link isConnected() open}, any attempt to modify the object
offsets will raise an exception: this is to prevent changing the connection properties
while connected.</p>
<p>In this class we make use of the {@link StatusTrait} trait, here we set the
{@link isDirty()} flag whenever we modify an object offset, and we reset it whenever we
open the connection; we reset the status bitfield data member after calling the parent
constructor.</p>
<p>This object represents the building block for all concrete instances that represent
servers, databases, data collections and caches.
+</p>
<ul>
<li>When parsing the data source name, using the {@link parse_url()} function,, this class
will perform the following associations:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><tt>scheme</tt>: <tt>{@link kTAG_CONN_PROTOCOL}</tt>. This corresponds to the server
    and database protocols, which must be the same.
<li><tt>host</tt>: <tt>{@link kTAG_CONN_HOST}</tt>. This corresponds to the server
    object connection host.
<li><tt>port</tt>: <tt>{@link kTAG_CONN_PORT}</tt>. This corresponds to the server
    object connection port.
<li><tt>user</tt>: <tt>{@link kTAG_CONN_USER}</tt>. This corresponds to the server
    object connection user code.
<li><tt>pass</tt>: <tt>{@link kTAG_CONN_PASS}</tt>. This corresponds to the server
    object connection user password.
<li><tt>path</tt>: <tt>{@link kTAG_CONN_BASE}</tt>. This corresponds to the database
    object name.
<li><tt>fragment</tt>: <tt>{@link kTAG_CONN_COLL}</tt>. This corresponds to the
    collection object name.
</ul>
<p>The above associations are stored in the object's offsets, which means that a collection
will hold its database name and all the parameters of the server connection.</p></div>

        <div class="details collapse"><p>This class extends {@link OntologyObject} to implement a concrete term object class.</p>
<p>A term object holds the necessary information to <i>uniquely identify</i>,</p>
<i>document</i> and <i>share</i> a <i>generic term or concept</i> which is <i>not related
to a specific context</i>.

For instance, a <tt>name</tt> is defined as a string or text that identifies something,
this is true for both a person name or an object name, however, the term <tt>name</tt>
will bare a different meaning depending on what context it is used in: the term object
holds the definition of that will not change with its context.

The class features the following default offsets:

<ul>
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_NID}</tt>: <em>Native identifier</em>. This required attribute holds
    the term global identifier. By convention this value is the combination of the
    namespace, {@link kTAG_NS}, and the local identifier, {@link kTAG_LID}, separated by
    the {@link kTOKEN_NAMESPACE_SEPARATOR} token. In practice, the global identifier may
    be manually set. This attribute must be managed with its offset.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_NS}</tt>: <em>Namespace</em>. This optional attribute is a reference
    to another term object that represents the namespace of the current term. It is by
    definition the global identifier of the namespace term. This attribute must be
    managed with its offset.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_LID}</tt>: <em>Local identifier</em>. This required attribute is a
    string that represents the current term unique identifier within its namespace. The
    combination of the current term's namespace and this attribute form the term's
    global identifier. This attribute must be managed with its offset.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_LABEL}</tt>: <em>Label</em>. The label represents the <i>name or
    short description</i> of the term that the current object defines. All terms
    <em>should</em> have a label, since this is how human users will be able to identify
    and select them. This attribute has the {@link kTYPE_KIND_VALUE} data type, which
    is constituted by a list of elements in which the {@link kTAG_SUB_LANGUAGE} item holds
    the label language code and the {@link kTAG_SUB_TEXT} holds the label text. To
    populate and handle labels by language, use the {@link Label()} offset accessor
    method. Some terms may not have a language element, for instance the number
    <tt>2</tt> may not need to be expressed in other ways.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_DEFINITION}</tt>: <em>Definition</em>. The definition represents the
    <i>description or extended definition</i> of the term that the current object object
    defines. The definition is similar to the <em>description</em>, except that while
    the description provides context specific information, the definition should not.
    All terms <em>should</em> have a definition, if the object label is not enough to
    provide a sufficient definition. Definitions have the {@link kTYPE_KIND_VALUE} data
    type in which the {@link kTAG_SUB_LANGUAGE} element holds the definition language code
    and the {@link kTAG_SUB_TEXT} holds the definition text. To populate and handle
    definitions by language, use the {@link Definition()} offset accessor method.
</ul>

The {@link __toString()} method will return the value stored in the native identifier,
if set, or the computed global identifier if at least the local identifier is set; if the
latter is not set, the method will fail.

Objects of this class can hold any additional attribute that is considered necessary or
useful to define and share the current term. In this class we define only those
attributes that constitute the core functionality of the object, derived classes will add
attributes specific to the domain in which the object will operate.</div>

        <div class="details collapse"><p>Objects derived from this <i>abstract</i> class hold two types of data:</p>
<i>run-time data</i>, which is stored in the object member properties and
<i>persistent data</i>, which is stored in the inherited array part of the object.

The main purpose of this class is to ensure that all persistent data elements are
<i>referenced</i>, <i>annotated</i> and <i>documented</i> in an ontology.

Persistent data is stored as <i>key/value</i> pair elements of the inherited array, the
key part of the elements we call by convention <em>offset</em>, these offsets, in this
class, represent a reference to an object of the ontology that holds all the necessary
information to <i>identify</i>, <i>describe</i> and <i>validate</i> the value part of the
array element pairs.

This class implements the bridge between object persistent data and the ontology,
ensuring that all data holds a reference to the ontology, which, itself, is implemented
by objects derived from this same class: this means that the whole system is self
sufficient and self documenting.

Offsets can be uniquely identified in two ways: by native identifier, which is an integer
value which may change across implementations, and a global identifier, which is a sring
that will not change across implementations. This class provides a transparent interface
that allows referring to offsets both by their <i>native</i> identifier or by their
<i>global</i> identifier. Offsets, however, <em>will only hold the native
identifier</em>, which means that all persistent data offsets must be integers. This is
because global identifiers may become large strings, which poses a problem if these are
used as field names for data stored in a persistent container.

Whenever the object is provided an offset, if this is a string, it will be fed to a
static method, {@link ResolveOffset()}, which will check if the string represents the
global identifier of an ontology Tag object, in that case, the method will return the
Tag's native integer identifier which will be used as the data offset. The class
features a static data member, {@link $sInternalTags}, that holds the list of exceptions.

This means that to ensure referential integrity it is advisable to use integer constants
as offsets when available, or string offsets if the integer constant is not known or
available.

The resolution of these offsets is provided by a {@link TagCache} object which records
all the <em>Tag</em> objects of the ontology which are the entities that all offsets
reference: persistent data offsets represent these Tag native identifiers, while these
Tag object global identifiers are decoded by the {@link TagCache} object to retrieve the
corresponding integer native identifier.

The class declares the {@link __toString()} method as virtual, it is essential that all
derived classes implement this method which should return the current object's <em>global
identifier string</em>. The global identifier of an object can be considered its
signature or unique identifier, although a global identifier not need to be unique; all
objects derived from this class, just as the Tag object described above, must feature a
global identifier, which may or may not coincide with their native identifier.

Finally, the class declares a method, {@link Reference()}, which returns the current
object's <i>reference</i>, this will generally be the value of the {@link kTAG_NID}
offset. If the offset is not set, the method will raise an exception. This method will be
put to use by derived classes: when providing an object to an offset expecting an object
reference, by using this method one can be assured the provided object does have a
reference.</div>

        <div class="details collapse"><p>This class extends {@link OntologyObject} to implement a concrete node object class.</p>
<p>A node is a <em>vertex in a graph structure</em>, nodes reference</p>
<em>{@link TermObject}</em> and <em>{@link TagObject</em> instances, when referencing a
term, nodes are used to build <em>ontologies</em>, <em>type definitions</em> and
<em>controlloed vocabularies</em>; when referencing tags they are used to build <em>data
structures</em>, <em>input and output templates</em> and <em>search forms</em>.

Node objects, along with edge objects, represent the presentation layer of the ontology,
users compose and consult network structures through these objects.

The class features the following default offsets:

<ul>
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_NID}</tt>: <em>Native identifier</em>. This required attribute holds
    an <em>integer serial number</em>, nodes do not have a unique persistent identifier,
    since they act as references and because you may have more than one node referencing
    the same term or property. The native identifier is assigned automatically.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_TERM}</tt>: <em>Term</em>. This attribute is a <em>string</em> that
    holds a reference to the <em>term object</em> that the current node <em>represents
    in a graph structure</em>. If this offset is set, the {@link kTAG_TAG} offset must
    be omitted. This attribute must be managed with its offset.
<li><tt>{@link kTAG_TAG}</tt>: <em>Tag</em>. This attribute is a <em>string</em> that
    holds a reference to the <em>tag object</em> that the current node <em>represents
    in a graph structure</em>. If this offset is set, the {@link kTAG_TERM} offset must
    be omitted. This attribute must be managed with its offset.
</ul>

The {@link __toString()} method will return the value stored in the {@link kTAG_TERM} or
the {@link kTAG_TAG} offset. This value represents the node persistent identifier, which
is not, however, unique.

Nodes cannot be uniquely identified via a persistent identifier, because more than one
node may share the same term or tag, this means that when searching for nodes you should
rely more on traversing a graph path, rather than selecting an object from a list.

Objects of this class can hold any additional attribute that is considered necessary or
useful to define and share the current node. In this class we define only those
attributes that constitute the core functionality of the object, derived classes will add
attributes specific to the domain in which the object will operate.</div>
