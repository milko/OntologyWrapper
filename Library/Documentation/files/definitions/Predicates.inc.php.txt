/**
 * Predicate definitions.
 *
 * This file contains the term global identifiers of the default predicates.
 *
 * Predicates are represented by a term object and serve as connectors between two vertex
 * nodes, these are the default predicates:
 *
 * <ul>
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_SUBCLASS_OF}</tt>: <i>Subclass of</i>. This predicate
 +		indicates that the subject of the relationship is a subclass of the object of the
 *		relationship, in other words, the subject is derived from the object. This predicate
 *		is equivalent to the <tt>IS-A</tt> predicate, it states that the subject is an
 *		instance of the object.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_SUBSET_OF}</tt>: <i>Subset of</i>. This predicate indicates
 *		that the subject of the relationship represents a subset of the object of the
 *		relationship, in other words, the subject is a subset of the object, or the subject
 *		is contained by the object.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_ATTRIBUTE_OF}</tt>: <i>Attribute of</i>. This predicate
 *		indicates that the subject of the relationship is an attribute of the object of the
 *		relationship, this means that the subject of the relationship should be of the
 *		{@link kKIND_FEATURE} kind.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_SCALE_OF}</tt>: <i>Scale of</i>. This predicate is used by
 *		scale vertices to connect feature or trait vertices, the subject of the relationship
 *		represents a scale or unit and the predicate indicates that the object of the
 *		relationship uses that scale or unit. This predicate is specifically used to
 *		indicate the different scales in which a feature ir trait vertex can be expressed
 *		in.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_METHOD_OF}</tt>: <i>Method of</i>. This predicate relates
 *		method vertices with feature vertices or other methods, it indicates that the
 *		subject of the relationship is a method, or workflow variation of the object of the
 *		relationship. This predicate is used to connect the pipeline of modifiers applied to
 *		a feature vertex.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_ENUM_OF}</tt>: <i>Enumeration of</i>. This predicate relates
 *		vertex elements of an enumerated set, it indicates that the subject of the
 *		relationship is an enumerated set element instance, and if the object of the
 *		relationship is also an enumerated set element instance, this means that the subject
 *		is a subset of the object.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_PREFERRED}</tt>: <i>Preferred choice</i>. This predicate
 *		indicates that the object of the relationship is the preferred choice, in other
 *		words, if possible, one should use the object of the relationship in place of the
 *		subject. This predicate will be used in general by obsolete or deprecated items. The
 *		scope of this predicate is similar to the {@link kPREDICATE_VALID} predicate, except
 *		that in this case the use of the subject of the relationship is only deprecated,
 *		while in the {@link kPREDICATE_VALID} predicate it is not valid.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_VALID}</tt>: <i>Valid choice</i>. This predicate indicates
 *		that the object of the relationship is the valid choice, in other words, the subject
 *		of the relationship is obsolete or not valid, and one should use the object of the
 *		relationship in its place. This predicate will be used in general to store obsolete
 *		or deprecated versions. The scope of this predicate is similar to the
 *		{@link kPREDICATE_PREFERRED} predicate, except that in this case the use of the
 *		subject of the relationship is invalid, while in the {@link kPREDICATE_PREFERRED}
 *		predicate it is only deprecated.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_LEGACY}</tt>: <i>Legacy version</i>. This predicate indicates
 *		that the object of the relationship is the former or legacy choice, in other words,
 *		the object of the relationship is obsolete or not valid. This predicate will be used
 *		in general to record historical information. The scope of this predicate is similar
 *		to the {@link kPREDICATE_PREFERRED} and {@link kPREDICATE_VALID} predicates, except
 *		that in this case the legacy choice might not be invalid, nor deprecated: it only
 *		means that the object of the relationship was used in the past and the subject of
 *		the relationship is currently used in its place.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_XREF}</tt>: <i>Cross reference</i>. This predicate indicates
 *		that the subject of the relationship is related to the object of the relationship.
 *		This predicate will be found generally in both directions and does not represent any
 *		specific type of relationship, other than what the edge object attributes may
 *		indicate. The scope of this predicate is similar to the
 *		{@link kPREDICATE_XREF_EXACT} predicate, except that the latter indicates that the
 *		object of the relationship can be used in place of the subject, while in this
 *		predicate this is not necessarily true.
 *	<li><tt>{@link kPREDICATE_XREF_EXACT}</tt>: <i>Exact cross reference</i>. This predicate
 *		indicates that the object of the relationship can be used in place of the subject of
 *		the relationship. If the predicate is found in both directions, one could say that
 *		the two vertices are identical, except for their formal representation. The scope of
 *		this predicate is similar to the XREF predicate, except that the latter only
 *		indicates that both vertices are related, this predicate indicates that they are
 *		interchangeable.
