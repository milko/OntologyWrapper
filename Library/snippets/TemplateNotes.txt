TEMPLATES:

The template root is a TERM NODE of kTAG_NODE_TYPE: kTYPE_NODE_ROOT and kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE.
The root term contains the label and definition of the template;
the root node contains the elements defining the template characteristics:
	kTAG_NAME:			The name of the template (used as identifier).
	kTAG_CLASS_NAME:	Name of the class of the object for which the template is.

A sub-template is a TAG NODE in which the tag MUST be a STRUCT and the node's kTAG_NODE_TYPE
must have kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE. Sub-templates are used to represent sub-structures as tables,
each sub-template is related to the root or parent template via a common property.
Sub-template nodes feature the following properties:
	kTAG_NAME:			The name of the sub-template (used as identifier).
	kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		In this case the property value contains the column identifier of
						the parent template to which the current sub-template record is
						related. This means that the symbol must exist in the parent
						template and that there must be an element of the parent template
						which matches the value of the current template property of that
						symbol.

Templates and sub-templates are related to TAG NODES which represet the template properties.
These property nodes must contain the following attributes:
	kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		This string represents the column identifier of the template,
						this symbol and the tag to which the node is related to represent
						the dictionary.
	kTAG_TOKEN:			This optional property contains the pattern tokens used to separate
						list property elements.
No property node may be of type struct.

Templates, sub-templates and properties are all related via the [:predicate:PROPERTY-OF]
predicate.
