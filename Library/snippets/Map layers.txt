The map selection should be divided as follows:

#### A. Empty base maps
|*Provider*|*Title*|*Level*|
|:---|:---|---:|
|Esri.WorldImagery|*Satellite*|0|
|Esri.WorldTerrain|*Terrain*|0|
|Esri.WorldPhysical|*Physical*|0|


#### B. Labelled base maps
|*Provider*|*Title*|*Level*|
|:---|:---|---:|
|ThunderForest.OpenCycleMap|*Cycle*|0|
|ThunderForest.Outdoors|*Outdoors*|0|
|OpenStreetMap.Hot|*Streets*|0|
|OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite|*Streets (black & white)*|0|


#### C. Labels
|*Provider*|*Title*|*Level*|
|:---|:---|---:|
|OpenMapSurfer.AdminBounds|*Boundaries*|110|
|Acetate.roads|*Roads*|120|
|Acetate.labels|*Labels*|130|


#### D. Environmental layers
*To be decided.*


#### E. Climate layers
|*Provider*|*Title*|*Level*|
|:---|:---|---:|
|OpenWeatherMap.Clouds|*Clouds*|310|
|OpenWeatherMap.CloudsClassic|*Clouds (enhanced)*|310|
|OpenWeatherMap.Precipitation|*Precipitation*|320|
|OpenWeatherMap.PrecipitationClassic|*Precipitation (enhanced)*|320|
|OpenWeatherMap.Rain|*Rain*|330|
|OpenWeatherMap.RainClassic|*Rain (enhanced)*|330|
|OpenWeatherMap.Pressure|*Pressure*|340|
|OpenWeatherMap.PressureContour|*Pressure (contour)*|340|
|OpenWeatherMap.Wind|*Wind*|350|
|OpenWeatherMap.Temperature|*Temperature*|360|
|OpenWeatherMap.Snow|*Snow*|370|


The *level* column represents the default level.

Level 0 represents the background, levels larger than zero represent the foreground. *If the library represents this in the inverse order, just look at this text upside-down*.

All maps in layer groups **_A_** and **_B_** share a single level, **_0_**, which represents the background. Whenever a map is selected, the current contents of the level are replaced by the new one.

Layer groups **_A_**, **_B_** and **_C_** have static levels, which means that their order cannot change.

Layer groups **_D_** and **_E_** have dynamic levels, which means that the user may re-arrange them to change their background/foreground order. The preferred way would be to allow dragging the selected elements to indicate the order.

Elements in map layer **_E_** which share the same default level are to be considered variations of the same layer: for instance, *Clouds* and *Clouds (enhanced)* represent the same layer, except that they are two variations of the same theme, this means that when their order is changed, both elements will share the new level.

Whenever a map from layer **_A_** is selected, all other layers are enabled; when an element of layer **_B_** is selected, layer group **_C_** is *disabled*.

The default layer map is *Esri.WorldImagery*.

All layer group elements with a maximum zoom level lower than the current zoom level should be disabled; this means that maps become enabled as the used reduces the zoom level.



================================================================================

Levels assignment (Level 0 to N is background to foreground):
- A and B => Level 0.
- C level 1 - 99
- D level 100 - 199
- E level 200 - 299

Behaviour:
- The default map is Esri.WorldImagery
- All layers that cannot display at the current zoom level must be disabled.
- Levels C, D and E must be draggable, to allow changing the foreground/background order.
