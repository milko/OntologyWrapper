Template
========

Templates need to track the following information:
	- The row number in which the column symbol can be found.
	- The row number from which the data starts.
	- The symbol of the column that holds the worksheet unique identifier.
	- The worksheet reference to which the current column refers to.
	- The structure in which the current column property will be stored.

Templates are defined as a graph shaped as a tree whose nodes fall into the following
categories:
	- Template node: this node represents the template, it should hold any information
	  regarding the template as a whole.
		- kTAG_TERM:			A term which contains the name and description of the
								template.
		- kTAG_DOMAIN:			The data domain of the template.
		- kTAG_CLASS_NAME:		The class name of the object the template is filling.
		- kTAG_NODE_TYPE:		kTYPE_NODE_ROOT, kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE.
	
	- Worksheet node: this node represents a table or spreadsheet worksheet, it essentially
	  represents a list of data properties.
		- kTAG_TERM:			A term which contains the title and description of the
								worksheet.
		- kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		The name of the worksheet, as in Excel.
		- kTAG_LINE_NAME:		The template line number where the column name or label can
								be found.
		- kTAG_LINE_INFO:		The template line number where the column description can be
								found.
		- kTAG_LINE_EXAMPLES:	The template line number where the column examples can be
								found.
		- kTAG_LINE_SYMBOL:		The template line number where the column symbol can be
								found.
		- kTAG_LINE_DATA:		The template line number where the column data starts.
		- kTAG_NODE_TYPE:		kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE.
	
	- Property node: this node represents a worksheet column, it describes the template
	  column and the object data property.
		- kTAG_TAGS:			The list of eventual structure tags in order.
		- | kTAG_TAG:			The reference to the tag corresponding to the column.
		- | kTAG_TERM:			A term is only used if the element represents a column which
								is used as a worksheet index and does not have a relative
								tag.
		- kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		The column template symbol.
		- kTAG_EXAMPLE:			A list of examples.
		- kTAG_DATA_KIND:		A set of qualifiers for the current value:
			• kTYPE_ESSENTIAL:	The value is essential or encouraged.
			• kTYPE_MANDATORY:	The value is required.
		- kTAG_TOKEN:			This optional property contains the pattern tokens used to
								separate list property elements.
		- kTAG_TRANSFORM:		This optional tag contains a list of structures used to
								transform and copy the current value:
			• kTAG_TAG:			The tag reference to which to copy the value.
			• kTAG_PREFIX:		The string to be prefixed to the value.
			• kTAG_SUFFIX:		The string to be appended to the value.
			• kTAG_CONN_COLL:	Collection name if the value represents an object reference.
		- kTAG_NODE_TYPE:		kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE, kTYPE_NODE_PROPERTY.

Root template nodes are pointed to by predicate kPREDICATE_COLLECTION_OF by the child
worksheets.

Worksheet nodes are pointed to by predicate kPREDICATE_PROPERTY_OF by the child properties.

The root template will have at most one relationship of predicate kPREDICATE_UNIT pointing
to the worksheet which represents the unit identification and root data.

The worksheet template will have at most one relationship of predicate kPREDICATE_INDEX
pointing to the property which represents the worksheet's unique identifier.

Index properties will have at most one relationship of predicate kPREDICATE_INDEX
pointing to the worksheet to which they refer; note that this is only valid for properties
which represent an index of another worksheet.
