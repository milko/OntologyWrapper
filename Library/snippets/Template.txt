Template
========

Templates need to track the following information:
	- The row number in which the column symbol can be found.
	- The row number from which the data starts.
	- The symbol of the column that holds the worksheet unique identifier.
	- The worksheet reference to which the current column refers to.
	- The structure in which the current column property will be stored.

Templates are defined as a graph shaped as a tree whose nodes fall into the following
categories:
	- Root node: this node represents the template, it should hold any information regarding
	  the template as a whole.
		- kTAG_TERM:			A term which contains the name and description of the
								template.
		- kTAG_DOMAIN:			The data domain of the template.
		- kTAG_CLASS_NAME:		The class name of the object the template is filling.
		- kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		The kTAG_ID_PERSISTENT of the template node representing the
								worksheet holding the unit identification and root level
								data, note that this is an exception behaviour.
		- kTAG_NODE_TYPE:		kTYPE_NODE_ROOT, kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE.
	
	- Template node: this node represents a table or spreadsheet worksheet, it essentially
	  represents a list of data properties.
		- kTAG_ID_PERSISTENT:	This property is required to uniquely identify worksheets.
		- kTAG_TAG_STRUCT:		The eventual reference of the structure containin the properties
								of the current worksheet.
		- kTAG_TERM:			A term which contains the title and description of the
								worksheet.
		- kTAG_NAME:			The name of the worksheet, as in Excel.
		- kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		The worksheet index column template symbol.
		- kTAG_NODE_TYPE:		kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE.
	
	- Property node: this node represents a worksheet column, it describes the template
	  column and the object data property.
		- kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		The column template symbol.
		- kTAG_TAGS:			The list of eventual structure tags in order.
		- | kTAG_TAG:			The reference to the tag corresponding to the column.
		- | kTAG_TERM:			A term is only used if the element represents a column which
								is used as a worksheet index and does not have a relative
								tag.
		- kTAG_ID_SYMBOL:		The column index of the property.
		- kTAG_NODE_TYPE:		kTYPE_NODE_TEMPLATE, kTYPE_NODE_PROPERTY.
